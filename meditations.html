                    <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
                    <p>Mindfulness Meditation is meditation that will teach you to experience rality as it is and to enjoy the given moment. It will also teach you to think about emotions without judgement. But the best about this meditation is that it will sharpen your focus and make it your best tool. You will learn to focus on only one thing at a time and to observe it as it is.</p>

        <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
        <p>Start by closing your eyes and deep breathing. The best position for this meditation is sitting on a chair, because in that scenario you will prevent yourself to fall asleep. While taking deep breaths, start thinking about flow of the air that gous through your nose to your lungs, and than go out. Focus all your thinking on that one happening. A lot of other thoughts will start to sabotage you on your way to mindfulness, but try as best as you can to ignore them. Imagine wind that lift the leafs up, and imagin putting on every distractting thought on that leaf that go away. Try your best to focus only on breathing. For beginners it's best to practice this meditation for 5 minutes and to build their way up. Good luck.</p>

        <h3>Body Scan</h3>
        <p>Start to scan your body by focusing first on your hair. Think about your hair. Then switch your attention on your scalp, then on your eyebrows, eyes, nose, lips, beard, neck, shoulders, arms, then all the way down to your chest and abdominal.

After finishing body scan from head to toe, go all the way up but slowly, starting second body scan in reverse way, this time from toe to head. Focus your mind on current moment and enjoy it.

                    <p>This is one step further Meditation because it will force you to think "out of the box", and to have much wider imagination. The meditation is made to help you think positive and to fill your life and mind with optimism. You can also improve your thinking and imagining things around you. It is a little different from a previus meditations, but it is definitely worth of trying.</p>

        <h3>Everything is Gold</h3>
        <p>Start meditation with mindfulness by focusing on your breath and breathing slowly and deeply. Close your eyes and get yourself in the position where you can't fall asleep. This meditation starts by imagining that your heart is gold. Imagine that your golden heart go outside of you and fly above your head, and after that the heart starts to open and to shower everything in your enviroment with gold. Everything becoming gold, the objects, trees, grass, people, houses, cities, countries. The whole world becoming golden. Imagine your golden heart leaving your house and pouring gold on streets and gardes, buildings and so on. Feel free to stay in this imagination as much as you want, and be grateful for everything you have.</p>

        <h3>View from Above</h3>
        <p>Start in alert body postition with closed eyes focusing all your mind to your breath. Try to feel air thet calculate through your body, similar like in Mindfulness Meditation. Then switch to third person perspective by imagining yourself meditating wherever you are. Feel the enviroment and imagine everthing that is around you. Than go higher in the sky and imagine the whole city you are at, or village. Imagine the citizens, other peoples with their problems, thoughts, jobs, worries and insecutities, and also their courage, inner battles and everything they are going through. Then go further in the sky and reach the border between sky and space, then fully leave the earth. Look the earth from above. Think about it. Ask yourself a questions, and give yourself answers, but try to use less judgement. Then imagine timeline and on thet timeline try to see all the scientists, inventors, philosophers, warriors, sportists and other people thet was give other people inspiration, and try to observe them. Then observe age that you live in, and after that try to imagine future. After that start slowly to lower yourself to the earth and to the ground. Go again through countries, cities, houses, and then come to yourself.</p>
